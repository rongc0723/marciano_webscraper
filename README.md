Boston Hacks Hackathon Project

## Inspiration
As a busy college student, I find myself developing bad eating habits and struggling to meet nutritional needs. I wanted to develop a tool that I can use to filter out the menu at the marciano dininghall so that I can eat healthier and plan my meals better.

## What it does
My project is a webscraper that scrapes the marciano dininghall website for food items that are being served on that day. It provides facts like calories, proteins, and carbs.

## How we built it
I used BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML contents of the marciano dininghall website and placed those contents into a csv file that is easier to analyze.

## Challenges we ran into
I worked on this project solo so I did not know how else to expand and improve on this tool. I wanted to develop an user friendly mobile app that displayed the information gathered in the csv file but I have no experience in developing mobile apps.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am proud of learning how to utilize BeautifulSoup and being able to come up with a solution that improves my life at college.

## What we learned
I learned that teamwork is crucial and having teammates would make my project exponentially better.

## What's next for Marciano Dining Webscraper
Perhaps presenting scraped data in a mobile app that can be customized to an user's athletic goals (bulking, cutting, maintaining, etc).
